<p> My Dear Nephew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;My deepest condolences regarding your father's death. I can't imagine how hard it must have been for you these past few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:63104/preview/app/index.html">But you and I both know that this was no accident. Your father was murdered that night. And it's up to you now to settle this.</a></p>
<p>My apologies for not being able to see you in person. The news was very sudden and I was out of the country by the time it reached me.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:63104/preview/app/index.html">I'm sorry to leave so suddenly, but I couldn't be caught. I have a lead, and given the coroner's reported time of death, I've narowed the suspects down to those present on the day of his Friday dinner party. </a></p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:63104/preview/app/index.html">6 suspects, to be precise: Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, Colonel Mustard, and Ms. Scarlet.</a></p>
<p>I also wanted to congratulate you on becoming the recent heir to the manor. It's in the best hands I can imagine. I'm sure you'll do a fine job as its new head of house.</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:63104/preview/app/index.html">Here's the thing: I think your father knew this would happen, and maybe who was behind it in the end. He sent me a note before that night, simply saying "check revolver".  I think he means the one in the biliard room? </a></p>
<p>I should be returning soon to give my regards in person. In the meantime, take care of yourself and the manor. I'm sure your father would be proud of you for being so strong.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:63104/preview/app/index.html"> I need you to investigate the house while I keep an eye on the suspects. I fear our culprit might make their move soon, and I need you to solve this mystery before that happens. </a></p>
<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:63104/preview/app/index.html">The killer won't make the same mistakes twice, letting your father clue us in so easily, so this may be our only opportunity.  Avenge your father, nephew, and be safe.</a></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Uncle Henry&nbsp;</p>
